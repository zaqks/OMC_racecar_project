racecar project implemented using JS on a webbrowser
to run the game just open index.html in your browser

fun fact: this game was made in ONLY 1HOUR

basically u need to avoid the incomming traffic
the game is a bit laggy since there is no memory management availble 
for this type of developpemnt 
collision detection wasnt implement and obstacles variety could be added
with sounds and more factors to make the game challenging 
but remember it was made in 1HOUR

sooo the way it works is pretty easy
its a game loop which spawn a car each defined ammount of time
i wouldve coded this in SDL and used a custom 3D engine and sound mixer
but no time
