racecar project implemented using JS on a webbrowser
to run the game just open index.html in your browser
and dont forget to open the devtools
press r to restart

fun fact: this game was made in ONLY 1HOUR

basically u need to avoid the incomming traffic & stay on the road
the game is a bit laggy since there is no memory management availble 
for this type of developpemnt soo its impossible to focus on graphics
maybe WebAssembly or typescript would do the work

collision detection wasnt implemented and obstacles variety could be added
with sounds and more factors to make the game mrore challenging 
but remember it was made in 1HOUR
for each car u avoid u have +10 

sooo the way it works is pretty easy
its a game loop which spawns a car each defined ammount of time
i wouldve coded this in SDL and used a custom 3D engine and sound mixer
but no time
this could be considered as a game and a webDev project 
as u like
